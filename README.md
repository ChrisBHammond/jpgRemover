# jpgRemover

This project came about with a need to save hard drive space. 
For years(before Adobe Lightroom) I took pictures in both Jpg and Raw format, to save time if I just wanted a quick JPG to share.
However now I use Lightroom and no longer need the JPGs, however I cant not just delete them.
I cant delete them because for some events I shot only JPGs. S
So I only want to delete a JPG file when there is a RAW file with the same name.
Thus this program is born, I started writting it in PowerShell but decided to make it a full easy to use program.
